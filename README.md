# Quicksort Algorithm in C++
This C++ program demonstrates the Quicksort algorithm, a widely used sorting algorithm known for its efficiency. The program allows you to generate random sequences, sorted sequences in ascending order, or sorted sequences in descending order. It also provides an option to check if the generated sequence is already sorted and measures the time taken to perform the Quicksort.

## Usage

### Compilation
Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example:
```
g++ main.cpp -o quicksort
```

### Execution
Run the compiled program with appropriate command-line arguments:

```
./quicksort
```

**Menu Options:**
   - **1:** Generate a random sequence.
   - **2:** Generate a sorted sequence in ascending order.
   - **3:** Generate a sorted sequence in descending order.
   - **4:** Display the current sequence.
   - **5:** Sort the sequence using Quicksort and display the time taken.
   - **6:** Exit the program.

  Note: Ensure you enter the length of the sequence when prompted at the beginning.

## Example

1. Enter the length of the sequence (e.g., 10).
2. Select option **1** to generate a random sequence.
3. Select option **4** to display the generated sequence.
4. Select option **5** to sort the sequence using Quicksort and display the time taken.
